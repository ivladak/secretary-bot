# secretary-bot
[Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/) which structures (classifies) messages sent to it and generates a digest later.
The idea is to talk to a robotic secretary in Telegram instead of talking to yourself (which I do all the time).
Messages I send myself usually fall into these categories:
- Ideas
- Quotes from articles I read on my phone
- TODOs and notes to self
- Things to check out later (movies, series, books, etc.)

# dependencies
